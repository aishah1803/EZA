businessinsider_article_detailed.csv,"Shopping looks a little different these days.Brick-and-mortar stores are acting like mini fulfillment centers. Self-checkout is becoming more common. Cash is out and QR codes are in.These shifts, which began with the pandemic, have lingered even as life in the US has mostly returned to normal. They've created a brave new world of retail that looks different than even three years ago, and worlds away from the retail heyday prior to the 2008 Recession — except for one major retail trend that's been resurrected in 2022.Here's what's changed, and what's come back from the dead.Stores have become a lot like fulfillment centersPATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty ImagesThe pandemic didn't kill brick-and-mortar retail, but it did change it.Retail locations still sell goods to in-person shoppers, sure, but they've also been drafted into the battle to keep up with e-commerce demand. Rather than rely solely on fulfillment centers to process and ship online orders, retailers like Ulta, Macy's, Best Buy, Nordstrom, Walmart, and more have started tapping into the inventory held by stores, too. That allows them to ship more goods and avoid telling customers something's out of stock, plus, items shipped from a store may arrive on the customer's doorstep faster than if it came from a regional distribution center,according to The Wall Street Journal.What's more, practices like curbside pickup and buy online, pick-up in store — known as BOPIS — aren't going away. While those options were available for shoppers pre-pandemic, they gained steam once lockdowns kept everyone at home. Nearly three years later, consumers have come to rely on them: 33% of adults under 50 say they're likely to keep using curbside pickup, according toa studyfrom the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.Plus, stores are becoming hubs for online returns. Returns are increasing thanks to the online shopping boom, and it's become an expensive headache for retailers, so much so that they've startedcharging shoppers to send back their unwanted goods— if they don't want to pay, they can return the products to stores for free.Related storiesBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to knowBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to knowCustomer interaction isn't the No. 1 priority anymoreKile Brewer for The Washington Post via Getty ImagesCustomer service has long been atthe center of the retail and hospitality experience, going as far back as the first Ritz hotel in the 1800s and informing the rise of department stores at post-World War II shopping malls.But these days, customer service looks totally different.Now, it's all about speed, convenience, and a touchless experience: many restaurant menus and retail signage still comesin the form of QR codes, both customers and retailers havelargely abandoned cash, and self-checkout is gaining store space at big-box and apparel retailers likeKohl's, H&M, Zara, Uniqlo, and Bed Bath & Beyond.Self-checkout is largely a hit with customers: 85% of shoppers perceive it as faster than waiting in line for a cashier and 60% say they prefer self-checkout over checking out with an associate, according toa 2021 surveyconducted by retail technology firm Raydiant.But it's also a cost-cutting move: self-checkout requires fewer in-store employees, and labor is one of thebiggest expensesof brick-and-mortar retailing. Labor, or the lack thereof, was also a factor in stores like Walmart, 7-Eleven, and McDonald'sreducing their operating hours, effectively ending 24-hour shopping. Almost three years later, those long store hourshaven't really returned.Big-box retailers are opening stores againJeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesWith all these changes, you'd think brick-and-mortar retail would be on its deathbed. But it's actually quite the opposite.Though theretail apocalypsedoomed plenty of retail locations before the pandemic, and a swath ofstores shut down in 2020, the picture looks different in 2022 and heading into 2023. Big-box retailers are opening more stores than they're closing for the first time in years, despite experts warning thatbrick-and-mortar would never recoverfrom the pandemic.Discount retailer Burlington has said it willopen 87 net new storesthis fiscal year, Ross Stores plans to add 92 net new locations this year, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls owner TJX has opened 104 stores this year, and Barnes & Noble is expanding by 30 new stores next year,The Wall Street Journal reported.Though there are still some retailers whose store count may dwindle in 2023 —department stores chief among them— the openings are a sign of a surprisingly strong period in brick-and-mortar, one that hasn't been seen inat least 15 years.",shopping looks little different daysbrickandmortar stores acting like mini fulfillment centers selfcheckout becoming common cash qr codes inthese shifts began pandemic lingered even life us mostly returned normal theyve created brave new world retail looks different even three years ago worlds away retail heyday prior recession except one major retail trend thats resurrected heres whats changed whats come back deadstores become lot like fulfillment centerspatrick fallonafp via getty imagesthe pandemic didnt kill brickandmortar retail change itretail locations still sell goods inperson shoppers sure theyve also drafted battle keep ecommerce demand rather rely solely fulfillment centers process ship online orders retailers like ulta macys best buy nordstrom walmart started tapping inventory held stores allows ship goods avoid telling customers somethings stock plus items shipped store may arrive customers doorstep faster came regional distribution centeraccording wall street journalwhats practices like curbside pickup buy online pickup store known bopis arent going away options available shoppers prepandemic gained steam lockdowns kept everyone home nearly three years later consumers come rely adults say theyre likely keep using curbside pickup according toa studyfrom apnorc center public affairs researchplus stores becoming hubs online returns returns increasing thanks online shopping boom become expensive headache retailers much theyve startedcharging shoppers send back unwanted goods dont want pay return products stores freerelated storiesbusiness insider tells innovative stories want knowbusiness insider tells innovative stories want knowcustomer interaction isnt priority anymorekile brewer washington post via getty imagescustomer service long atthe center retail hospitality experience going far back first ritz hotel informing rise department stores postworld war ii shopping mallsbut days customer service looks totally differentnow speed convenience touchless experience many restaurant menus retail signage still comesin form qr codes customers retailers havelargely abandoned cash selfcheckout gaining store space bigbox apparel retailers likekohls hm zara uniqlo bed bath beyondselfcheckout largely hit customers shoppers perceive faster waiting line cashier say prefer selfcheckout checking associate according toa surveyconducted retail technology firm raydiantbut also costcutting move selfcheckout requires fewer instore employees labor one thebiggest expensesof brickandmortar retailing labor lack thereof also factor stores like walmart eleven mcdonaldsreducing operating hours effectively ending hour shopping almost three years later long store hourshavent really returnedbigbox retailers opening stores againjeffrey greenberguniversal images group via getty imageswith changes youd think brickandmortar retail would deathbed actually quite oppositethough theretail apocalypsedoomed plenty retail locations pandemic swath ofstores shut picture looks different heading bigbox retailers opening stores theyre closing first time years despite experts warning thatbrickandmortar would never recoverfrom pandemicdiscount retailer burlington said willopen net new storesthis fiscal year ross stores plans add net new locations year tj maxx marshalls owner tjx opened stores year barnes noble expanding new stores next yearthe wall street journal reportedthough still retailers whose store count may dwindle department stores chief among openings sign surprisingly strong period brickandmortar one hasnt seen inat least years,Positive

Online Shopping Memberships: Walmart vs Amazon
February 10, 2021

Walmart launched a
subscription program
in September 2020 called Walmart+, and it already has about 8 million members, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, LLC (CIRP). That compares to the approximately 142 million US members in Amazon Prime, which launched in 2005.
Josh Lowitz, Partner and cofounder of CIRP, said after
Walmart retired the acquired Jet.com brand
, and possibly with a boost from the pandemic, the retailer now has a substantial online presence, which he called comparable in some ways to Amazon. “At $1,000 per year for the average Walmart.com customer, average annual spending is remarkably similar to the long-term figure for Amazon,” Walmart is still early in the growth of its online business, so there are key differences in scale, he noted.
Another interesting data point from CIRP: Walmart+ members account for 14% of Walmart.com customers, compared to the two-thirds of Amazon.com customers who are Amazon Prime members.
A key factor for Walmart.com: it is succeeding in taking advantage of the company’s dominant grocery business, according to CIRP partner and cofounder Mike Levin.
CIRP
, “which provides securities research to the investment community using advanced consumer market research strategies, methods, and techniques,” based its findings on surveys of 500 US subjects who made a purchase at Walmart.com in the period from November 2020-January 2021.

forbes_random.csv,"No, we're not talking about dancing avatars in virtual malls. The retail industry is on the cusp of its most dramatic transformation yet. In 2025, retailers are using AI and machine learning not just to track inventory but to predict and adapt to disruptions before they become crises. As AI handles routine tasks, retail workers are evolving into experience orchestrators armed with digital tools and data insights. When giants like Ikea, Levi's, and Zara are launching their own resale platforms, you know the game has changed. If you're still thinking of social media as just a marketing channel, you're missing the bigger picture. It's not about the metaverse – it's about making digital shopping better. It's about building supply chains that bend rather than break. If recent years have taught us anything, it's that supply chains need to be as adaptable as they are efficient. While sustainability isn't new to retail, 2025 marks the year when it becomes a core business driver rather than a nice-to-have initiative.",talking dancing avatars virtual malls retail industry cusp dramatic transformation yet retailers using ai machine learning track inventory predict adapt disruptions become crises ai handles routine tasks retail workers evolving experience orchestrators armed digital tools data insights giants like ikea levis zara launching resale platforms know game changed youre still thinking social media marketing channel youre missing bigger picture metaverse making digital shopping better building supply chains bend rather break recent years taught us anything supply chains need adaptable efficient sustainability isnt new retail marks year becomes core business driver rather nicetohave initiative,Negative
retaildive_article2.csv,"As consumers and retail leaders alike observe the five-year anniversary since COVID-19 temporarily closed down the world, the staff at Retail Dive is remembering that era and examining its impact on the retail industry.
In March 2020, our staff embarked upon an effort to
track the industry’s response
. Store by store, we attempted to keep up with how retail was altering operations to provide products and services to shoppers while still keeping safety at the crux of decision-making. There were temporary store closures, staff furloughs, changing mandates regarding mask requirements and social distancing procedures. (Remember plexiglass shields? Holding merchandise that had been tried on for 24 hours? Stores finally allowing a limited number of customers back in stores?)
It was a difficult and confusing time — one where retailers had to remain flexible in order to serve their customer base. While life since that time has largely returned to normal, the pandemic left a lasting impact on how consumers interact with stores and how their expectations have changed.

the_sun_article (1).csv,"FOR some people, trying on clothes is a drag.
Picking out the items and waiting in line while trying to nail the size, color, and style before putting everything on can be time-consuming and exhausting.
Complaints about unforgiving lighting and a lack of privacy are also common.
So, step forward, LA-based VR specialistIndestry. They have created a swankyvirtual mirrorthat lets you try on new clothes and even order them without taking a stitch off.
There are plans to have the devices in subways and at bus stops, helping people do their shopping on the move with minimal fuss.
Indestry owner Alex Poulson showed The U.S. Sun his revolutionaryHero Mirrorrecently which is being used at concerts and sporting events.
Fans can decide which singer or sporting hero they want to have a picture with before an AI version of their idols appears on the screen.
Thesnapcan be sent to your email in the blink of an eye.
Indestry describes the Vyu Try-on Mirror as an ""augmented reality try-on mirror that blurs the lines between physical and digital retail.""
""Whether in a bustling retail store, iconic sports stadium or high-traffic event venue, "" says their official website. ""Vyu gives users the opportunity to wear any clothing item in a real-time, instantly-fitted form.""
Englishman Poulson first immersed himself in the world ofvirtual realityby bringingWilliamShakespeare back to life as part of a UK government initiative.
He has also worked with iconic sporting franchises like theSan Francisco 49ersand soccer giantsLiverpool.
But the virtual mirror is his latest creation, which he hopes will be installed in shops, public places, and consumers'homesthroughout 2025.
It was launched in thesummerof 2024 forDoja Catat iHeartRadio inLas Vegas. Indestry digitized and displayed her clothing on their system.
""Starting in 2025, we aim to expand it into something like thePelotonof home clothing trials,"" Poulson told The U.S. Sun.
He explained that the conception is a mirror, a physical screen fitted to a wall.
Users can scan a QR code with their phone, which turns it into a controller. From there, they can select clothing that appears in 3D.
The cutting-edgetechnologytracks the skeleton in real-time, morphing the 3D clothing to fit approximately 50–80 skeletal points.
Of course, customers can't feel the fabric, but ""the texture is rendered to simulate details like wool.""
The idea is to let users visualize clothes quickly and accurately within minutes, whether in multiple styles or colors.
""It's a real time saver,"" said Poulson. ""Think of it as trying on clothes at home without putting them on.""
The concept was created during the COVID-19pandemicas online shopping rates soared and fears over story closures multiplied.
Although the notion of a virtual mirror isn't new, according to Poulson, what sets the Vyu Try On Mirror apart is its affordability and the ability to roll it out at multiple locations at once.
""Technology often starts as an idea but takes years to develop. Many virtual solutions aren't scalable or ready for broad deployment,"" he explained.
""Ours works at scale and is affordable for retailers. We’ve designed it to run on optimized hardware, making it suitable for large rollouts in 1,000 stores or public installations.""
The aim is for retailers to adopt this in their stores and for consumers to use the mirror at home to help with all their clothing needs. As they are drawn to the brand's e-commerce site, traditional advertising is ""transformed into an interactive and engaging experience.""
""If you have ever wanted to explore the options of seven different colors of the same t-shirt but don't have the time, this is for you,"" said Poulson.
