pandemic even became obvious digitalization internet posing major risk retail arching traditional format high street location obviously ecommerce huge component conversation strategic kind direction majority brands trying adopt pandemic obviously made visible clear requirements digital presence indeed kind online like better term completely essential seems though ones ready absolutely successful across board whether marketing mechanisms indeed secure payments whatever might able get online really allowed businesses thrive indeed brands havent able make transition clearly really really suffered yeah absolutely actually leads next question ed perspective many brands ready take advantage kind early mover advantage came flexible terms approach think show brands potentially found hard depending investment digital think noticed specifically stores failing kind reflect store online experience personally speaking going store good experience knowledge everything experience go online cant access store wasnt replicated think stores specifically established brands invested making sure theyre instore experience reflected online well succeeded know succeeded well think know sort websites companies still trying get right terms making sure everything store things great needs position kind really reflect online presence well like social store front website everything im making sure experience user want continue shopping store changed way purchased moving forward think know many like brands still struggling sort expectation consumers continue engage past potentially think could theyre space people past months discovered new brands therefore know established ones loyalty towards may know search social discovered new company able explain benefits online show video show social therefore loyalty changed something dont think youve missed boat think know key thing lot online retailers trying invest moment think ones got right know know whats pandemic hit certainly benefited terms kind conversion rate customer retention perspective know audience fascinated find consumer behavior changed actually interacting brands kind brick mortar stores online comes retail capacity course pandemic yeah definitely think definitely kind agree increasing popular online shopping consumer behaviors throughout pandemic kind including went first lockdown right whilst back march went first lockdown kind seeing around people saying theyve making purchases online saw really quickly leap april way december actually still seeing percent still saying theyre shopping online add usual kind top kind despite restrictions used still seeing people saying actually returned store buy nonessential items last month think kind weve analyzing behavior walnut behavioral science lens behalf retailers work going showing peoples status quo theyre kind regular behaviors actually shifted us going get used getting need familiarity online shopping process behavioral science shows us tend prefer things familiar pandemic referring store shopping know know familiar pandemic forced sort adapt online shopping familiarity biased seeing store much less prevalent sorry resistant changing behaviors unless weve got really compelling reason known status quo bias behavioral science essentially means context online shopping become norm theyre going need really compelling reason shift back store kind going offer something really different something beneficial versus theyre getting online well know one thing already really accelerating faster others think side personal experience would seen today well demographics fundamentally changed im experience mine parents shopping therefore installer buy certain items things like kind forced upon actually know good experience online shopping think thats thats know multiplied lot people think brought whole new demographic online stores need improve upon accessibility side things website design areas think ultimately changed lot use data demographic data data people would review kind audience personas marketing know typical know target audiences think thats weve seen side lot demographics look change based know arent people online shopping based know play postpandemic world demographic shift ongoing process much know sort stopped started past months expect know going like going forward still demographic shift go think idea could stand still way perhaps done unlikely think kind material change ongoing level education risktaking innovation frankly thats gone go online lot businesses understanding demographics getting look like better way thats going keep happening learning exercise like high street shops formatting think shift back physical although partially likely wont necessarily important perhaps way people engaging retail online environment way experiencing think kind time goes newfound norm actually things probably change even direction probably wait even heavily towards digital things biggest

actually lot technology providers allow experiences easily placed environments done extraordinarily well theyre thats happening kind consumer infrastructure intensive investment areas kind pretty profound ways think yeah theyre interesting kind liar within mix truly proven worth lot industry going center stage really long time nice fantastic big beneficiaries ecommerce boom think beneficiaries kind twofold think great nudge accelerate smaller brands developing online stores kind giving nudge forward theyve kind slowly moving towards past years think also kind undoubtedly helped lot huge brands like amazon example think cant kind shy away much helped think particularly interesting one research perspective look amazon river things often see kind mismatch peoples attitudes beliefs comes amazon kind feels throughout pandemic like attitudes put little bit back burner comes attitudes mean kind see lot people talking disliking idea shopping large corporate companies shopping smaller retailers also amazon kind feeling like perhaps less sustainable way shop see lot people talking amount packaging coming theyre ordering extreme level ease especially past months amazons kind really helped plug gap people havent able nip shop get things meant despite attitudes people continued shop shop ever think kind mismatch attitudes peoples actual behaviors kind creates sense cognitive dissonance shoppers makes feel like bit uncomfortable actions dont match beliefs think going really interesting see continue move pandemic things like sustainability shift back onto agenda whether people going start shift behaviors better align attitudes nice fantastic want take advantage yeah know case expect see continuously specifically guess due pandemic people stuck indoors looking invest homes garden also importantly looked purchase products wanted information previously may got install got knowledge educated customers think mentioned companies agile certainly companies know noticed

also daytoday stuff yeah think try focus specifically like search agency proactive think theres nothing worse know client seeing another company competitor sing something based kind initial hindsight based kind data think search understand people asking online looking shift time example reason netflix like stranger things something current inspires like fashion suddenly people searching dungarees online offering havent know established presence successfully sell gym equipment due pandemic people arent going gym competitor invested build home gym online videos set everything kind made home
