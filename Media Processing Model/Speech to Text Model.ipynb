they considered to be the future of retail and e-commerce so we discuss everything from what that means how to get in contact with them if you want to pick their brains about anything that's all you hear in this episode hello I'm Mark Mitchell I'm a co-founder and chief Innovation officer at Lively agency my role in life is to try digital executions to bring a brand experience to life very nice fantastic and my name is that so I'm going to say consultant impression so I focus on the organic acquisition through search for kind of startups to International Brands very nice fantastic and I'm the search manager at market research agency will not unlimited as an agency we focus on human understanding so using a combination combination of traditional market research methods and tools grounded in neuroscience and Behavioral Science to true to get to the heart of white people do what they do and how Brands can influence the behaviors of their consumers and walnuts team of retail experts so I work with a number of clients across the sector particularly over the last 18 months kind of focusing on Guiding brands play the ever-changing circumstances and now helping to position them as we come out of the pandemic nice what we're going to be talking about which is how do we take what we've learned during the pandemic and really apply it to Consumer Behavior going forward but yeah I wonder if maybe we could we could begin Mark if you take us through what have been some of the biggest Trends in retail of the past few years and then we can still get into how they've been affected and even accelerated by the pandemic in a little bit I think it's it's play secret that even before even decade a decade before the pandemic even became obvious that the the digitalization and the internet was posing a major risk to retail over arching in its traditional format of being a High Street location obviously e-commerce has been a huge component of conversation and its strategic kind of direction of where the majority of brands have been trying to adopt the pandemic obviously has made that so visible and clear that the requirements for a digital presence and indeed kind of being being online for like a better term is is completely essential and it seems as though the ones that were ready for it have been absolutely the most most successful across the board and whether that be from a marketing mechanisms and indeed have a secure payments or whatever that might be being able to get online and has has has has has really allowed businesses to thrive or indeed brands that haven't been able to make that transition as clearly have really really suffered yeah absolutely and actually that leads me on to my next question which is Ed from your perspective how many Brands were ready to take advantage of that kind of early mover Advantage when it came to more flexible in terms of their approach I think more of them will show Brands potentially found it hard depending on their investment in digital I think what I noticed specifically is stores failing to kind of reflect their in store to online experience so just personally speaking me going into a store and having that good experience of of that knowledge and everything about that experience where is when I go to online because I can't access that store that just wasn't replicated so I think the stores that specifically did it more of the established brands that invested in making sure that they're in-store experience was reflected online as well and succeeded you know succeeded well and I think you know some some sort of websites and companies now are still trying to get that right in terms of making sure everything that they do in store and things that are great that needs to be in that position to to kind of really reflect that on in their online presence as well so like the social store Front the website and everything that I'm making sure that that experience is there for the user should they not want to continue shopping in store or you have changed the way they purchased them moving forward and then do you think that there were you know many of those like brands are still struggling with that is that sort of an expectation that consumers will continue to engage with them as they have in the past potentially but I think it could be that they're in that space that I have people in the past 18 months have discovered new brands because of this so therefore you know the established ones that they had loyalty towards they may have you know through search through social discovered a new company that were able to explain benefits online or show through video show through social so therefore that loyalty has changed or something don't think you've missed the boat I think you know it's a it's a key thing that a lot of online retailers are trying to invest in at the moment but I think the ones that had got it right you know you know before what's the pandemic hit certainly benefited from that in terms of kind of conversion rate and and customer retention from your perspective that I know our audience will be fascinated to find out how consumer Behavior has changed how we're actually interacting with Brands both in kind of brick and mortar stores and online when it comes to a retail capacity and over the course of the pandemic yeah definitely I think we definitely kind of agree with that increasing popular online shopping and consumer behaviors throughout the pandemic kind of including before we went into that first lockdown and right up to now and whilst back in March so before we went into that first lockdown we were kind of seeing around 18% of people saying that they've been making more purchases online because I saw that really quickly leap up in April to being 45% and then all the way up to 68% in December and we're actually still seeing that 43 percent are still saying that they're shopping online add more than usual and kind of on top of that kind of despite those restrictions now being used were still only seeing a 50% of people saying that they had actually returned to store to buy non-essential items in the last month and I think kind of we've been analyzing this Behavior at Walnut through Behavioral Science lens on behalf of some of our retailers and what our work is going to showing is that people's status quo they're kind of regular behaviors have actually shifted with us now going to get used to and getting most of what we need familiarity with the online shopping process and Behavioral Science shows us that we tend to prefer things that we're familiar with so before the pandemic they were referring in store shopping because you know it was what they know is what they were most familiar with but the pandemic is forced to sort to adapt online shopping so now this familiarity biased that we were seeing before to in store is much less prevalent and sorry resistant to changing our behaviors unless we've got a really compelling reason to do so and this is known as the status quo bias in Behavioral Science and essentially what it means in this context is that for those who online shopping has become the norm they're going to need a really compelling reason to then shift them back into store it's kind of going to have to offer them something really different and something beneficial versus what they're getting online now well I know that one thing already which are really accelerating faster than the others I think from my side and this is just a personal experience but what would be seen with you today as well how is the demographics of fundamentally changed because I'm just a few experience of mine is that my my parents who are 60 + 509 shopping and therefore only when installer to buy certain items and things like that now they had to have this was kind of forced upon them but they actually you know have now good experience of online shopping but I think that's that's been you know multiplied for a lot of people so I think it's brought in a whole new demographic online stores that need to improve upon accessibility side of things with website design and and then those areas but I think ultimately it's changed a lot of use of data and demographic data data that people would have had to review their kind of audience personas to who are they are marketing to and you know who are their typical you know Target audiences such I think that that's what we've seen from our side is that a lot of demographics look to change based on you know who aren't on who which people are online shopping now based on you know play post-pandemic World of demographic shift and ongoing process and how much of it has been you know sort of stopped and started over the past 18 months are we now where we will expect you know this is what it's going to be like going forward or is there still more demographic shift to go I think that the idea that it could stand still in the way that perhaps it has done is is unlikely I think that there will be a kind of a material change in an ongoing there has been such a level of education and risk-taking and Innovation frankly that's gone into having to having to go online and a lot of the businesses and now understanding what those demographics that they are getting through to look like in a better way and that's just going to keep on happening it's a learning exercise just like the the the the the High Street shops formatting and I think that the shift back to physical although partially likely won't necessarily be as important perhaps as the way in which people are engaging with retail in an online environment and the way in which our experiencing that and so I think that as kind of more time goes by in this newfound Norm actually things will probably change even more in that direction and and probably wait even heavily towards digital as things the biggest beneficiaries of this you know we've seen some of the verticals you know health and well-being because obviously been a huge boom industry of the last couple of months in terms of e-commerce but who have been the idea that the sectors or the brands that you think are really taken advantage of this well and any of you can answer that one and if the well interestingly I actually think it's the service providers that have a lot of the add the infrastructure to enable the more agile businesses to be able to adopt digital strategies I mean people like Shopify for example the sort of sass layers or stripe and its payments mechanisms actually a lot of the technology providers that allow experiences to be more easily placed in these environments have done extraordinarily well because they're that that's happening into this kind of consumer infrastructure for all intensive and investment in those areas is kind of pretty profound in some ways so I think that yeah they're an interesting kind of liar within the mix that have have truly proven their Worth to a lot of the industry and are going to be Center Stage for a really long time nice fantastic and then some of those big beneficiaries of this e-commerce boom I think for me the beneficiaries have been kind of two-fold I think it's been a great nudge to accelerate some of those smaller Brands and developing their online stores and kind of giving them that nudge forward that they've been kind of slowly moving towards over the past few years but I think it's also kind of undoubtedly helped out a lot of those huge Brands like Amazon for example I think you can't kind of shy away from how much it's helped them out I think it's a particularly interesting one for from a research perspective to look at the the Amazon River things we often see kind of a mismatch between people's attitudes and beliefs when it comes to Amazon and it kind of feels throughout the pandemic like those attitudes have been put a little bit on the back burner and so when it comes to those attitudes what I mean is that we kind of see a lot of people talking about disliking the idea of shopping with large corporate companies and of shopping with those smaller retailers and also with Amazon kind of feeling like it's perhaps a less sustainable way to shop we see a lot of people talking about the amount of packaging coming through when they're ordering the extreme level of ease especially over the past 18 months when Amazon's kind of really helped to plug that Gap from people haven't been able to just nip out to the shop to get things has meant that can a despite those attitudes people who have continued to shop with them and Shop with them more than ever before and I think what this does this kind of mismatch between this the attitudes and people's actual behaviors as it kind of creates this sense of cognitive dissonance for Shoppers which makes me feel like a bit uncomfortable that their actions don't match their beliefs and I think it's going to be really interesting to see as we continue to move out of the pandemic and things like sustainability shift more and more back onto the agenda whether people are going to start to shift their behaviors to better align with their attitudes again or not nice fantastic you want to take advantage of that yeah you know it's not the case and should we expect to see that continuously specifically I guess due to the pandemic and then people being stuck indoors looking to invest in their own Homes and Garden so and then also most importantly when they looked at purchase these products they they wanted information of what to do with them where is the previously may have got that install or got more knowledge educated their customers on how to do that so I think when I mentioned before about these companies that have been agile certainly the companies that you know noticed maybe you know a sudden sudden you know purchases common for the website and then automatically you know customers quite through commission this content make sure that you know content was on the website calculators tools assets that will be able to make sure that when the customers you know acquire this this product they're able to do something with it and I think when I mentioned I think it's those companies that were able to be quite proactive and expect that and and invest in that content that can help you yeah kind of help their customers I'm going to change the next question a little bit because you've all answered the questions of an organization in e-commerce proposition and how they should actually go and do it effectively how are you probably got a really interesting take on this how is the agency involved now in this new relationship yeah I guess from a market research agency perspectives slightly different I guess are rolling and supporting retail marketing campaigns generally can come in at any stage from that kind of initial ideation to pre-testing optimization and right for you to kind of measuring effectiveness we know that kind of getting to know your your your your humans and really understanding those consumers and emotional level is going to be what's going to be most effective and driving that long-term growth for Brands I think the biggest way things are changing for us as an agency is kind of making sure that marketers have the right research tools and advice at their disposal to ensure that their campaigns can really deliver on driving those and emotional connections with their is provide the level of innovation to and actually challenge clients to do more and to ensure that they are looking at strategies that they otherwise wouldn't be being prepared having a perspective and having a position on how to approach something new could work and so yeah I definitely think that the role of technology and and and and and indeed strategically as to what aspects of a campaign or indeed a strategy is being put together I think that the agency is role is to is to challenge that as heavily as possible and there's still that Innovation is is Innovation is the new creativity here and without it but the brands will get left behind and we really are seeing a Moment In Time whereby the way in which people are interacting with content digitally is developing it's such a pace and there's so much more investment so much focus on this and so much more case studies to draw upon the actually yeah you really have to the agencies have to present ambitious and Big Ideas I think that's really interesting Ed from your perspective how many of those big ideas are you presenting or you really more on the sort of I suppose that in the trenches and really advising also day-to-day stuff yeah I think what we what we try and focus on specifically as like a search agency is being proactive because I think there's nothing worse than you know a client seeing another company or a competitor sing something based on them having kind of initial hindsight based on some kind of data and I think being in search we understand what people are asking online and and looking at shift over time so for example if for some reason a Netflix such as like stranger things or something current inspires like 80s fashion then suddenly people are searching for dungarees online and you have the offering but you haven't you know established that presence successfully or if you are you sell gym equipment and due to the pandemic people aren't going to the gym and your competitor has invested in how to build a home gym online and videos how to set everything up which is kind of what I made with the Home and Garden you need to have that proactive approach of if understanding how you're already searching and and finding information and you know consumer online and how you can be you know proposing that towards the client and being able to say this is how you say searching this month this is how we expect how we can act on this how we can be proactive rather than allowing that Trend to happen and then 3 months down the line reacting to it later quite you know too late because you've not been able to get development or sign off on a lot of things it's been it's preempted a lot of Trends and being able to have that that overview of what's happening in the industry and proposing these ideas before competitors or for that for that potential trying to pass yeah and you actually answer the question I didn't even know I had which is why so many people aren't hungry again so thanks what are you most excited about when it comes to the future of retail and e-commerce because we could talk about you know what's the chance of the past 18 months for for hours and hours and hours it's been a huge and fundamental change but looking forward then what are some of the things coming down the pipe that you are most excited about so hairy I wonder if we could begin with you please yeah sure I guess I kind of have the a research based perspective on this but I think with regards and probably most I think we're seeing more and more of our clients really investing in virtual reality as a tool to help them with the design of some of those retail experiences in store and to really help them use the voice of the customer to guide their decisions here and I think it's it's a really immersive way of researching that can really help put those real behaviors and emotions at the Forefront of any of their new retail ideas and I think also just the general acceleration of the use of virtual feet virtual reality can be really a powerful tool for a retailers more generally too and just for example as it being a way of bringing those products into the home without people needing to leave the house I know personally during the pandemic and I move flats and needed to get some more furniture and I think there were a lot of kind of furniture providers out there who would as ever mentioning been super agile and got ready with them bringing in tools so that we could virtually use some of those Furniture pieces within our flat I think it was obviously necessary during the I think just that use of VR I think it's been on the back on sort of coming to life over the past few years but I think the pandemic has really helped to accelerate that forward as well and I think it's going to be a really exciting tool yeah absolutely and I just ran a piece for the drum actually about exactly that about how to retail brands are using our to really sort of engage consumers with us in store experience is or whether that is as you mentioned kind of that at home are that really helps almost streamline a big fan of flexibility and also I guess scalability should have you know any Commerce website since successful growth in this period I think you know the Headless CMS approach and Atlas e-commerce specifically I think allows a lot of companies to adapt as they as they grow and be able to scale a flexibility I think as mentioned working with clients we've certainly highlighted issues where it's not being able to adapt the the current store friend or just been issues you know that that have led to delays 3 to 6 months not being able to be as productive as we like so I think adaption of these and being able to kind of be more custom with your with your setup and being able to yeah use be more scalability and flexible with your website will allow us just to be a bit more proactive and understand Trend data and understand what to write them nice fantastic and then you'll have a slightly different perspective on it I suspect so what are you most excited about sure so I think overarching the it's it's it's been really interesting to see how the technology technology has been used across retail I mean there is you say rightly that the in-store experience is kind of the starting point but actually the the at home one is is in some ways the real the real challenge the real opportunity that that's there and more and more people are looking at these Technologies and as you said already are and being able to look at the shoe on your foot before you've purchased it for example is is just an incredible way of being able to deliver an actual experience and having some tactility if you like to to the to to purchasing something and I think engagement and something that allows the user to get involved in a new way what is is is is the trick to and that's what actually is delivering an experience and that's what's converting things because as soon as someone is able to play it becomes personalized almost natively and as a result of that personalization they are so much more likely to actually you know convert and I think as well that anything rich media is is as soon as mobile really kind of became centerfold and you know personally through Instagram or Pinterest or whatever it might be engaging with with video and and other assets like that have a really really valuable but as we move forward I think live is going to become way more of a focus for resale than it currently kind of is and is understood to be like live streaming in real-time purchasing and the idea that you can be and it's not like this this horrible idea of sort of Telly sales back in the day is like a very way more modern equivalent of that influence there's been a ton of examples of that starting to happen that Tommy Hilfiger did a really interesting thing and there's there's there's a lot of moments I think whereby we're going to start seeing applications whereby you're watching things and purchasing them as you're watching them and video and the retail and conversion mechanism kind of get blended into the singular tool and yeah you know whether that is that kind of like aspect of it but then I suppose not to take advantage of that we're going to have to have agencies and Brands who are almost ahead of the curb curb of the curb so if you could maybe a bit of advice on where excited about but the thing that you are always the Brownstones of it where should people be looking to invest their time and resources at the moment sure I like I think that I think that it's diversification is probably the most important sensible answer to that to that in that you know you can't turn your back on physical retail and you can't put all your eggs in one basket because because consumer Trends do change and I think that being able to successfully have a foot not in all places but in in in in in in all of the obvious ones is the most logical way of doing it not having a digital strategy isn't a strategy so I think that I think that yeah people that know what they're doing are going to ensure that they can cover off the bases and be able to adapt to those things that you know actually is Ed said a moment ago you know having those tools that allow you to be more is probably the best place to to to to to to to to settle down where should France be really place in their chips when it comes to getting out of the retail terms of the future yeah I think I have a few but I think the first one that I we've been really focused on is testing everything I think you can afford expensive mistakes balls so we love working with companies that kind of an open to understanding cast everything that may may not work and I may work and being able to kind of create a library from that in terms of understanding what has worked for them and what hasn't and where to double down their office I guess specifically in the marketing side of things in terms of the so many kind of testing propositions now in terms of split testing across so many channels I think you know exploring that especially if you're a new brand I think it's exploring that understanding the day to understand what works well with you and then fundamentally I think focus on Brian building with all campaigns making sure that it's just having a good experience I think just due to how competitive now is competitive it is now in the e-commerce space you know and you know cost per clicks and everything like that is is huge so that you know customer retention is a is a key goal and being able to attract customers and make sure that you providing them with that good experience and making sure that they're coming to you again rather than having to compete for them in in marketplaces is gonna why don't you have a healthy save a lot of money in the future focus on experience isn't going to get lost as we transition to that kind of much more online version of retail and then where should I be where should we be placing our attention almost what should we be paying the most attention to I think kind of from our perspective is going to be all about really humanizing that digital retail journey I mean we've all seen that this big push from Brands to make sure the websites and apps function world to cope with all of these increasing demands but I think with more and more people continuing to shop online rather than in store I think people are going to be looking to Brands who is digital environments provide them with those authentic interactions and those that expert knowledge that store colleagues were previously have offered and ultimately with kind of that transparency to help build and maintain the trust in your brand as well before I thank you all I wondered if you could maybe share the best place to get in contact with you so if any of the audience what's the best place in to reach you could be company website and it could be your email could be a LinkedIn sure yeah I mean a couple places where you can reach me and you can reach me

            " welcome to curb enthusiasm I'm Emily weidenhoff and I'm Denise Mendes on this episode we chat with Dr Anne good child and is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Washington and founding director of the urban Freight lab she leads the University's academic and research efforts focusing on supply chain Logistics and Freight Transportation good child is an international expert in the area of public-private collaboration 100 novel Publications welcome and so excited to have you today hello over there in The Evergreen State we'd like to really just jump right in why should our listeners care about Freight policy Freight policy affect people's lives quite directly on the certificate of exposure to traffic Can freight Vehicles side Freight Vehicles tend to be some of the largest on our roads they tend to be some of the most polluting in terms of emissions per mile so being around them is something that we need to put a lot of care and thought into so you know on one side there's there's kind of managing those vehicles and making sure that they can operate safely in our environments where we live and then on the other side the cost of afraid to the cost of moving Goods has a direct effect on the cost of the things that we need to live so food and you know retail products and appliances everything has to be moved to you and so if there are very high costs if that's very slow it increases and adds to the cost of consumers pay so those are the two I think most direct ways in which no Freight affects our lives that isn't so visible so sometimes I think it's easy depending on where you live to kind of move around in the world and not see it but it really does have those two very distinct effects on people's lives yeah I really appreciated you know that reference and thinking about the necessity and sort of why we need Freight access to Fresh supply of goods Services Etc but there are certainly and understanding that Freight is governed by federal state and local regulations how do you see that balance instead of a nuanced recognizing that larger trucks do impose those safety challenges and sort of thinking about how to be balanced access to getting those deliveries with also sort of the safety implications as well so for me one of the most effective things I've seen is engagement regularly with the diverse so I think when we isolate ourselves as you know policy makers or operators or drivers or you know users of that system when we when we don't communicate with the other stakeholders on the topic that's when we tend to overlook complexities you know that may not affect us or we simplify things to single story so I think the most important thing that we can do to work towards balance where everybody's you know needs are heard but also concerns are heard is through that connectivity and and in Freight you know that happens in in the space I work in in the urban Freight lab we have no members from a big range of kind of private sector stakeholders so people that are actually you know operating trucks people that are receiving Goods but also real estate technology provider software providers sort of a wide swath of the private sector stakeholders but also the public sector government officials elected officials but also kind of the people who live near and rely on this system so I think you know balance is something we will continue to to have to pursue it's not something we figure out and then we're done it's as the world changes as the environment changes as the economy changes we continue to have to update our sense of what balance is but I think the way we do that best is by communicating with each other and hearing each other's concerns and having about like a inclusive approach to decision-making and policy-making yeah I love that love that it's just it's an ongoing ongoing work could you share a little bit about what motivated you to start the urban Freight lab and and talk about some of the successes as well as some of the goals moving forward yeah I love to the urban Freight lab what is a public-private work group housed at the University of Washington intent on improving the safety sustainability and livability of the urban Freight System when I engaged in you know my kind of independent career as a researcher so where I was leading investigations I looked around at my peers that I thought you know did it really well and I tried to learn from them I think research that has impact on practice is like that's the highest standard for me there were two groups that I was really familiar with one that called metrans which was at USC and Cal State Long Beach and so I saw that they had you know this this structure for regular ongoing engagement with the people living and creating the system that they were trying to study and then I also saw that at MIT the CTL Center for transport and Logistics they have add a membership-based community of private sector companies tended to be more kind of retail and transport and Logistics and that was how they you know built trust understood problems and it was again kind of a structural component to their research so I thought I need that I need long and deep relationships with the people working in the space that I'm trying to study you know as a researcher you don't live that everyday until you can't understand it the way people do who live it and work it yeah so it was you know really being inspired to do good work and inspired to do kind of impactful work and then looking and seeing what I could learn from other people who were who were trying to do that in a little bit different context but in a similar way to what I was looking to do it's really been inspiring seeing the progression of the urban Freight lab in Seattle and I do remember serving as one of the expert panel reviewers for the launch of the urban Freight lab back in 2016 for me I think about the value of public-private partnership but also the value of bringing the academic rigor to that conversation to ground truth initiatives and really think about their impact and value we are at really sort of an inflection point in thinking about how do we even drive change and innovation in urban Freight what in your opinion do you see is the role of government that's something that New York City has really been a leader in trying to Pioneer and set of create that space through our faded advisory committee but also through creating a similar structure like the urban freak lab but maybe being a city LED initiative so can you speak to the role of government and where you see that developing I think the place where I see a need is in the more complex char faces like much of our Urban regions where we have a complex set of goals a complex set of users and it can be difficult to balance and to meet all of the needs and and I hesitate to say that cuz you can't really meet everybody's desires and so that's where with the urban Freight lab I think we've been able to play a really key role in making a space for understanding kind of AC it's kind of the public and the private sector shifting to this this idea where we're going to say what we want public sector engagement and kind of innovation and to encourage change in particular directions with Freight is very new and organizationally institutionally most of our agencies really aren't set up to do that that hasn't been the role that they've been playing so I think with the urban Freight that was a space we were really able to help which was as researchers who want to look for how we can improve and how we can measure and and move you know our kind of systems in a direction that benefit us all that was a really needed kind of structure instead of skills that weren't part of the private sector they were thinking about their their own needs but you know they didn't typically think about how do we engage in conversations around public space and shared space and and they also on the public side really weren't used to thinking a whole lot about Freight and then also about how do we encourage innovation in a space that we don't have a lot of history in terms of understanding or being engaged with it's so encouraging to hear how much you sent her communication and talking to to so many diverse stakeholders you also look at transportation and Freight Systems as you said at the regional scale and looking additionally I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the influence of geography and infrastructure and how that changes the challenges to different Regional Freight Systems as well as opening opportunities often when people think about kind of freight and traffic we do take this like pretty Regional concept people will say Seattle or they'll say New York you know they'll say the Bay Area and actually what we micro distribution are actually you know happening at at a neighborhood scale or you know some of the features of our transport system important features are not present in the whole region so you know Seattle is is home to a container Port we also move Goods in other forms but we have a container port and in Seattle and so some of the you know impactful elements of that are highly localized to the area around the port almost every Community has kind of neighborhood scale for a challenges or the potential for new Solutions and so that doesn't even need to be kind of at a city governance level right that can be a compass an airport a shopping mall a medical center a large industrial complex play there's there's a Boeing facility in our region that is you know larger than most towns and so they have internal Transport Systems that are kind of at the scale of of other communities and so yeah some of what we think about with freight and transport is regional and there are different classes of of cities and how they might approach that some are like Seattle some might become like Seattle and some may never but I think all communities do have like neighborhood scale smaller scale challenges or opportunities to implement solutions that can be kind of similar even though the context is very different that's a really great Point around potentially thinking about transferability of solutions it's really important to think about context-sensitive approaches and I think you're really touched on that hey listeners we hope you're enjoying this play the sound of our podcast for those of you who are as enthusiastic about transportation and planning as we are we'd like to hear from you you can submit topics and questions that you'd like us to cover at nyc.gov forward slash curb enthusiasm and now back to our conversation Denise and the freight team here at dot have run and developed and are continuing to develop amazing programs that I think play unlock Next Level opportunities to think about our streets for people our streets as public realm so just thinking about blue highways micro hubs the locker NYC pilot being smart about Freight in a way that centers people and I think we all have a strong personal connection to our packages it's not just the stuff but it's the people that deliver the stuff you know growing up a dear friend of my family Mike the mailman was a little bit of a local Legend and you know an incredibly important part of the community and connected not just packages but but people I feel safer at night walking home with my Amazon delivery worker who's on my block you know who I know even just around the corner from our office there's a memorial to PS worker that a building felt you know really strongly about and and really felt his loss and so I'm wondering to you know she hear from you how centering people really impacts Freight Solutions and how that is shaping the future of a freight particularly you know in the urban context I have to shut up Denise and her team because if you are like not in the freight world or she does great work for the city but like she's had an impact on the international great world and programs that have been developed there are notable around the globe and it's remarkable so absolutely Freight Fame I have a UPS driver who's been delivering to us since we moved here I almost 20 years ago Carla she gets a little toot every time she drives by and she knows my parents live next door and if they're away she'll bring their package over and as you said you know it's it's an asset like a Community Asset to have those people in our communities just present noticing things you know sharing information there are other models right where you have a more more ad hoc delivery team and people are moving in much larger sections of a community and so they're not present so often and they don't get to know a place so well it's felt like and maybe this is more with the with the Advent of e-commerce and the increase in the amount of delivery people are getting that you know you'll see pictures on the internet of someone saying you know why are there for delivery vehicles in my neighborhood everyday so a sense of of intrusion you know my perspective is we we should be part of of saying what do we want and collectively you know what are we kind of willing to pay and what how convenient do we want this thing to be and it should be go back to Freight policy a thing that that we discuss and maybe we decide no we don't want four vehicles in our neighborhood everyday gosh you know what could we think about for other Solutions we might say yeah we'd rather have you know only small vehicles in our neighborhood were willing to you know host a hub nearby or willing to wait a little bit for our packages so those should be things that were talking about and we feel like we're engaged and there's a way for us to have an opinion and share an opinion that gets listened to I'm happy that we brought up the conversation around empathy particularly for the folks that are on the front lines oftentimes maybe the active ordering something online separates you from sort of that that transaction right like you make the decision to purchase a product and then it's sort of like a black box in terms of the time you do that and then it gets to your home and so I think that's something that we've been actively thinking about how do we engage communities think about trade-offs how do we engage communities to think about better choices around consumer habits like we have all become accustomed to the convenience of ordering online and you know just how do you sort of approach those conversations so if you can shed some light on that that would be really great so I've been trying to think about like what are because sometimes it's very hard to look at that model and now that it's kind of adopted and and enjoyed by a lot of people you know to think about changing I tried to think about what are other models that people like and have worked that maybe have other benefits or other costs and you know we were talking about the sort of familiar delivery person or the postal worker who you know has been doing your route for a long time like that's a model that people enjoyed and has secondary benefits that are kind of hard to count and I thought about you know post office is right post offices are little warehouses now they're relatively small right sort of zip code level and the other warehouses where your goods might be coming from are much much larger than a post office on average and they're farther away from your house and so they tend to have you know larger vehicles are more efficient for driving longer distances so and people don't mind having post offices in their neighborhood right I like it when there's a post office in my community would be lovely if I could and it feels like a Community Asset there are multiple services that I can access their there might be voter registration you know there might be Community Information there might be someone selling Girl Scouts cookies you know outside of the front of it it's aesthetically a good fit in the neighborhood you know there's usually no some green space there's it's a welcoming place so I think we can look to models where we have smaller more locally accessible you know and like Depot and warehouse is a word that doesn't sound like something you want your neighborhood so we need to come up with some other language but like a post office or a corner store right or a corner shop right where we can distribute and we can use smaller Vehicles less intrusive Vehicles less intrusive facilities that do offer what are the assets and maybe that's trusted people maybe that's other community services maybe that's a little bit of green space but I think that is how we can get Goods into our communities in ways that that we enjoy that bring positive attributes to our communities and you know that's what I would want to work towards I really appreciate that Nuance in the reframing particularly of sort of thinking about it as an asset rather than and that is certainly something that will be important in terms of how we frame conversations with community and broader stakeholders as well so I want to ask you what is your biggest breach of public transit etiquette but I also feel like maybe we want to hear what is the biggest breach of post office etiquette here's what my thing about the post office lately so you know you go into the post office and you're like trying to be prepared right cuz where I go there's always a queue and I have a child who lives outside the country so I'm sending things to her and you have to fill out the Customs form and you have to get the right envelope that's going to be good for international post or whatever so you're standing in a cute and you're trying really really hard to fill out the right warm so that you're fast when you get up to the counter and like you're not rejected and then there's the ambiguity of like do you have to go to the back of the line or can you kind of go off to the side while you fill out the forms very stressful to know like because now some people in the line think you're cheating because you didn't go to the back of the line and so there's like this ambiguity you know am I am I able to just like fill this out on the side and then come back we just kind of but or do I have to go back to the end of the queue so that's what that is the stress for me yeah totally although maybe that's something you you know about from a systems perspective is the is it better for the overall flow of the network to go to the side and pause and rejoin or go to the back of the line I think for the system it is agnostic but for the individual it's better to go to the side okay I do want to get your perspective on the future of freight there have been a lot of Buzz about drone deliveries and whether or not that's applicable in dense Urban environments say like New York City but we're seeing so much movement in the space and even for autonomous or Eevee tolls or electric vertical take-off Landings related Freight deliveries between ports I'm curious what your most enthusiastic about particularly for last mile delivery is just play Urban Freight space I am most excited about information and it's not the sexy kind of technology that is so visible but our ability as individual kind of consumers but also as a freight system as supply chain manager has been completely transformed right our ability to kind of see the system we used to just know it's like the library you just knew when the book came in and out but if it got put in the wrong but we really do have the ability to sort of see that system intervene in that system understand that system in ways that have allowed us to completely transform I mean it's really why we have e-com and it's why we can have home delivery I think that's the most exciting most transformative technology and it's happening and we don't you know we kind of passively experience the most exciting thing to me is the ability to do kind of lightweight electric vehicles most of the over-the-road fleet is still kind of 100-year-old technology excessively heavy excessively energy-intensive and no of course it costs money to ship that over and not everyone is in a position to do that so to the extent to which we can kind of help tolerate that is really exciting so smaller Vehicles more right size vehicles lighter-weight vehicles are good for interactions with pedestrians are good for sound and and sort of noise disruptions they're good for emissions so I think I'm excited about lightweight electric vehicles but I'm really excited about walking I'm excited about people riding bikes we can use the tools of kind of data and operations to still rely on really clean smart solutions that include basically walking and biking definitely and I'm not excited about drones I'm not excited about robots I think a robot is incredibly expensive error-prone you know I understand that we're developing those Technologies and they'll be very applications for them but I don't see you know delivering packages as a as a use case as a as a requirement for really automated sophisticated kind of you know two-legged robots or four-legged robots I think they have other sensible applications and I think there's still a lot of the human you know presence and the human capacity that is valuable is probably undervalued in terms of you know back to sort of presence in the neighborhood and decision-making and I think we should continue to use that as solution particularly for kind of very last mile complex environments great and thank you so much for your time today we appreciate the conversations that you're having the community that you're building and the critical thinking that you are bringing to this incredible Freight layer of Transportation I enjoyed it so much and the same back to both of you I just really appreciate your work in this space and you're interested so it's been hi my name is Danny Rodriguez commissioner New York City Department of Transportation thank you for listening to curb
