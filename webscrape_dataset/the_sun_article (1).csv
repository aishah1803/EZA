AI mirror lets you try on new clothes from the subway or bus stop by scanning your skeleton to make outfit feel real,2025-01-28T19:30:11+00:00,No author found,no categories found,"FOR some people, trying on clothes is a drag.
Picking out the items and waiting in line while trying to nail the size, color, and style before putting everything on can be time-consuming and exhausting.
Complaints about unforgiving lighting and a lack of privacy are also common.
So, step forward, LA-based VR specialistIndestry. They have created a swankyvirtual mirrorthat lets you try on new clothes and even order them without taking a stitch off.
There are plans to have the devices in subways and at bus stops, helping people do their shopping on the move with minimal fuss.
Indestry owner Alex Poulson showed The U.S. Sun his revolutionaryHero Mirrorrecently which is being used at concerts and sporting events.
Fans can decide which singer or sporting hero they want to have a picture with before an AI version of their idols appears on the screen.
Thesnapcan be sent to your email in the blink of an eye.
Indestry describes the Vyu Try-on Mirror as an ""augmented reality try-on mirror that blurs the lines between physical and digital retail.""
""Whether in a bustling retail store, iconic sports stadium or high-traffic event venue, "" says their official website. ""Vyu gives users the opportunity to wear any clothing item in a real-time, instantly-fitted form.""
Englishman Poulson first immersed himself in the world ofvirtual realityby bringingWilliamShakespeare back to life as part of a UK government initiative.
He has also worked with iconic sporting franchises like theSan Francisco 49ersand soccer giantsLiverpool.
But the virtual mirror is his latest creation, which he hopes will be installed in shops, public places, and consumers'homesthroughout 2025.
It was launched in thesummerof 2024 forDoja Catat iHeartRadio inLas Vegas. Indestry digitized and displayed her clothing on their system.
""Starting in 2025, we aim to expand it into something like thePelotonof home clothing trials,"" Poulson told The U.S. Sun.
He explained that the conception is a mirror, a physical screen fitted to a wall.
Users can scan a QR code with their phone, which turns it into a controller. From there, they can select clothing that appears in 3D.
The cutting-edgetechnologytracks the skeleton in real-time, morphing the 3D clothing to fit approximately 50–80 skeletal points.
Of course, customers can't feel the fabric, but ""the texture is rendered to simulate details like wool.""
The idea is to let users visualize clothes quickly and accurately within minutes, whether in multiple styles or colors.
""It's a real time saver,"" said Poulson. ""Think of it as trying on clothes at home without putting them on.""
The concept was created during the COVID-19pandemicas online shopping rates soared and fears over story closures multiplied.
Although the notion of a virtual mirror isn't new, according to Poulson, what sets the Vyu Try On Mirror apart is its affordability and the ability to roll it out at multiple locations at once.
""Technology often starts as an idea but takes years to develop. Many virtual solutions aren't scalable or ready for broad deployment,"" he explained.
""Ours works at scale and is affordable for retailers. We’ve designed it to run on optimized hardware, making it suitable for large rollouts in 1,000 stores or public installations.""
The aim is for retailers to adopt this in their stores and for consumers to use the mirror at home to help with all their clothing needs. As they are drawn to the brand's e-commerce site, traditional advertising is ""transformed into an interactive and engaging experience.""
""If you have ever wanted to explore the options of seven different colors of the same t-shirt but don't have the time, this is for you,"" said Poulson.
