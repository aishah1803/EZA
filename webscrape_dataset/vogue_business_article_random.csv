This article on AI and virtual stores is part of our Vogue Business membership package. As Gen Z’s spending power is slated to eclipse that of any generation that came before it, gaming is beginning to influence online shopping, with 3D, immersive spaces increasingly sharing online real estate with traditional e-commerce grids. Advances in artificial intelligence are accelerating this process, making it both easier for brands to build virtual stores and possible for virtual spaces to be personalised to each individual shopper — giving another leg-up to this emerging gamer-friendly format.
